    "improved_version": "Hi everybody, welcome back to the channel. Today we are going to solve another five Spark question, and this question was asked like you can expect this question in almost every MNC. This is the most ideal question for a fresher or a person who has experience around one or two years of experience in data engineering. So this is generally to test your knowledge in the basics of Spark in this part basically. So let's see the question. The question is you need to return the details of employees whose location is not in Bangalore. If you see the employee ID name location column, you have two employees with the locations Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune. So you need to return the details of employees whose location is not in Bangalore. So first, you need to unpack this list of locations and have it as an individual row, and then you need to filter out that location should not be equal to Bangalore. So this is how we are going to solve this question. As you see, I have already imported a Spark session, and you can have your Spark SQL functions imported. Then I'm creating a Spark session with a Spark session dot builder dot get or create. First, we will create a data frame. The data I'm taking is using the 'withColumn' function to add the 'location' column, and we are using the 'explode' function, which splits the locations into different individual rows using a split based on the column. Then we are displaying our final data frame, in that we are selecting the columns that we want (in this case, employee ID, name, and location), and we are doing the filter where the location is not equal to Bangalore. So this is our final output. If you like this video, please subscribe to the channel and follow for more content like this. Till then, see you in the next one. Bye.",
    "overview": "Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and the use of articles. Remember to use singular verbs with singular subjects and plural verbs with plural subjects. Additionally, ensure that verbs agree in tense throughout your writing."
